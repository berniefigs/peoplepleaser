        This online magazine, PEOPLE PLEASER, aims to raise awareness <br>
        of the falsities of social media. This topic screams importance <br>
        to me, due to the fact that social media is heavily unregulated. <br>
        A black hole of fake news and distorted realities. Why don't more <br>
        people speak out about how detrimental it can be on our health?  <br>
        It becomes an unhealthy energy exchange if used incorrectly. <br> <br>

        The purpose of this project is to give you some resources to  <br>
        learn about what's underneath the surface, the psychological  <br>
        effect of social media on our brains. Hopefully this project   <br>
        will spark your interest all the while help you become more   <br>
        self aware, urging you to make cautious decisions on <br>
        the inters of web.

  <div class="container2"><h3>THE PITFALLS OF <img src="heart.png"style="width: 10vw;"><br> SOCIAL MEDIA</h3> <br><br>
    <div id="main"> 
      <div style="background-color:white">
      Social media has not been around long enough for a sufficient amount <br>
      of research to come forth on a verdict on if its overall effect deems to be <br>
      damaging or not. Social media is constantly changing and evolving, which <br>
      entails that there has not been any long term studies executed. Nothing good <br>
      ever comes out of excess, especially something that is boundless. <br><br>
      In 2006, a podcasting company, Odeo needed a fresh, new idea to reinvent <br>
      themselves. Jack Dorsey introduced the idea of creating SMS (short message <br>
      service, a.k.a. texting) that would enable a user to communicate with a small <br>
      group of people. Then there’s Mark Zuckerberg, who created Facebook to <br>
      connect with people. At the time the Internet was only useful for information <br>
      and services, but no real way to connect people together virtually. So you <br> 
      could say social media was not born in vain, especially when these CEO’s  <br>
      prioritized the value of social connection. Social media is also great for <br>introverts, shy folks, communities, and long distance relationships. It is<br>
      great for keeping friends and family updated on our new life circumstances.</div>
        <div style="background-color:white;">
     There is insufficient amount of data to prove its long term effects, so we <br>
    cannot set any kind of guidelines or regulations yet. But investing in social <br>
    media too frivolously can eventually result in harmful impact, like caring <br>
about the wrong things that do not actually matter in real life. But with an <br>
increase in screen time and decrease in IRL (in real life) time, empathy and <br>
compassion start to diminish due to lack of real life social interaction. We <br>
haven’t even discussed the horrors of cyberbullying, but that’s another can <br>
of worms to breakdown. I worry that this type of technology could be  <br>
dangerous to a user who isn’t self-assured in oneself. <br><br>
Have you ever stopped to think about how addictive social media really is? <br>
When you wake up, is the first thing you grab your phone? Are you constantly <br>
refreshing your timeline, waiting to feel satisfied? Do you enjoy that rush you <br>
get when you post something and receive a ton of feedback? For every like we <br>
receive, we get a high, a shot of dopamine and we are in a loop. It is so addictive <br>
that makes it quite difficult to quit and has users coming back for more. The

dilemma becomes user vs. self and user vs. user on who can come up with the<br>
best, creative content that produces a surplus of likes and followers. Arises this<br>
lowkey competition that happens online on who looks the best, who is the most<br>
creative, or who has the freshest fit. The unavoidable truth is when we see others<br>
online, we can't help but compare. Young people may be unaware that their peers<br>
are merely just posting their highlight reel: their physical appearances, life achieve-<br>
ments— perceived success. When users compare, some tend to feel FOMO (fear of<br>
missing out), which is strongly linked with the use of social media. The more<br>
frequently the user will check their timeline, the more comparisons will happen<br>
throughout the day.<br><br>

One small study out of the University of Pittsburgh concluded that there is in fact a<br>
causal link between the use of social media and negative effects on well-being,<br>
primarily depression and loneliness. The study was published in the Journal of Social<br>
and Clinical Psychology.
</div>
        <div style="background-color:white;">

“What we found overall is that if you use less social media, you are actually less<br>
      depressed and less lonely, meaning that the decreased social media use is what <br>
      causes that qualitative shift in your well-being,” said Jordyn Young, a co-author <br>
      of the paper and a senior at the University of Pennsylvania. <br><br>
      The researchers mention that this is the first time a causal link has ever been <br>
      established in scientific research. <br><br>
      Instagram is currently testing out a new feature that would remove likes and <br>
      follower count. Only the account user will be able to see the number of likes a <br>
      post receives. It’s not a good look to be named the most harmful social media <br>
      platform, this could be a solution. Instagram says the reason for this update test <br>
      is to have users focus more on content and interaction with the app rather than <br>
      likes. The hope is by removing the likes it could also curb those nuisances about <br>
      not getting an adequate amount of likes and to eliminate "competition". This <br>
      has the grand possibility for more authentic, positive environment.

        Back in 2017, the United Kingdom’s Royal Society for Public <br>
        Health published #StatusOfMind, a report that examined how <br>
        different social media platforms impacted people’s mental or <br>
        physical health. Almost 1,500 teens and young adults <br>
        participated, and Instagram got the worst rep, being ranked <br>
        as the worst app for your health. It was associated with high <br>
        levels of anxiety, depression, bullying, loneliness, sleep <br>
        quality, FOMO and body image.  <br> <br>
        Instagram was designed for creative and expressive purpose<br>
        of image sharing. In the beginning no one really took it<br>
        seriously, until a few years ago. I blame the intertwinement<br>
        of DTC (direct to consumer) brands and social media, which<br>
        resulted in a chaotic evil. Influencer marketing has always<br>
        been around, celebrities endorsing products on commercials or<br>
        magazine ads. But the birth of the DTC era exacerbated the<br>
        influencer pool to new heights. Through social media influencers<br>
        can advertise directly to the consumer. It starts to get<br>
        personal, because people get to see this influencer’s<br>
        transparent, authentic self. Then users trust their endorse-<br>
        ments; a subtle yet impactful method of persuasion to sell a<br>
        product. Instagram is misleading for this very reason: that<br>
        people are showcasing their perceived private lives on a public<br>
        platform; so the question how authentic is it, or are people<br>
        just constructing an online persona? <br><br>
        Instagram is overruled with influencers, really attractive<br>
        internet celebrities. The Instagram influencer market is<br>
        projected to reach a value of $2 billion globally by this<br>
        year, according to media marketing agency MediaKix.<br>
        Specifically, influencers in the fitness field are making the 
</div>
       <div>
        big bucks on the Instagram platform. Users source “fitspiration”<br>
        for get inspired and motivated, which is a fitness influencer<br>
        whose content consists of sometimes tasteful half naked photos,<br>
        lifestyle and workout videos. Research shows this has the opposite<br>
        effect, making people feel worse and does not in fact correlate to<br>
        an increase in exercise or health outcomes. Considering the height<br>
        of celebrities and influencers dominating Instagram, it makes these<br>
        beautiful strangers an everyday person in your virtual reality,<br>
        giving more opportunity for comparison as a user scrolls through<br>
        their timeline. With body dissatisfaction at an all time high, people<br>
        are starting to rely on face slimming face filters and Facetune to<br>
        alter how they look. <br><br>
        “If you think about all these apps you can use now with filters and<br>
        manipulating the body, it’s almost like you’ve got Photoshop in your<br>
        phone. You are literally manipulating or photoshopping your image to<br>
        conform with social norms, to be evaluated by others,” said Cohen. <br><br>
        Some people get so used to how they look on Facetune or Snapchat or<br>
        Instagram filters that it is driving them to seek surgery. We're<br>
        currently living in a phenomenon of people requesting procedures to<br>
        resemble their digital image which is termed as “selfie dysmorphia”<br>
        or Snapchat dysmorphia. Where is the fine line between a photo filter<br>
        from VSCO and straight up changing the appearance of your face <br>
        structure? A report in the US medical journal JAMA Facial Plastic Surgery <br>
        suggested that filtered images’ blur the lines of reality and fantasy, in <br>
        which could potentially be triggering body dimorphic disorder (BDD), a <br>
        mental health condition where people become fixated on imagined defects <br>
        in their appearance. <br><br>
        In 2017, a study in the journal Cognitive Research: Principles and

        Implications found that people only recognized manipulates images<br>
        60-65% of the time, causing “unrealistic expectations of what is <br>
        normal” and has the potential to destroy one’s self esteem. It <br>
        becomes a vivacious cycling of getting insecure while scrolling <br>
        through Instagram, then manipulating images, then someone seeing <br>
        the manipulated image.. completely unaware that it has been altered,<br>
        feel like shit about themselves. <br><br>
        The issue with Snapchat and Instagram filters are they get rid of<br>
        any sign of human. They plump your lips, erase your pores, accentuate<br>
        your jawline, and making your eyes pop.<br><br>
        Fillers have become so prevalent, which leads to bigger procedures.<br>
        Some doctors even tried to market off of Kylie Jenner’s lip fillers<br>
        with this “Kylie package: nose, jaw, and lips”. It's not taboo any-<br>
        more to see doctors post the work they have done on patients to <br>
        advertise. Instagram has become a marketplace for cosmetic surgery. <br><br>
        Most recently Instagram banned some selfie filters that mimic plastic<br>
        surgery, claiming it to be damaging to teens. On the bright side this ban<br>
        is part of new efforts by Instagram to hunt down content related to dieting, <br>
        detoxes and domestic surgery. It’s sad for young girls to grow up in this<br>
        era, feeling as if their natural state will never compare to their air-<br>
        brushed selfie filter face. Influencers have a huge platform and should be<br>
        using it to influence positive reinforcements, considering how much power<br>
        they hold nowadays to shift pop culture.</div>

        <B>1. How do you feel social media & <br>
the internet distort your reality?</B> <br>
It’s so easy to distort your own reality <br>
through social media. You could be <br>
having the shittiest of shitty days, but <br>
as long as you post an Instagram that <br>
looks like you’re having the time of your <br>
life, no one will ever know. And then <br>
when you look back on it months later, <br>
chances are you won’t see happiness  <br>
behind your own eyes, but instead you’ll <br>
only see your pain and suffering that no <br>
one else knew about, because how <br>
would they??  <br> <br>
<b>2. What makes social media danger- <br>
ous to mental health? </b> <br>
The amount of reasons why social media <br>
is dangerous to mental health is endless. <br>
Whether it’s because of cyberbullies or <br>
internet trolls or unrealistic photos of <br>
Instagram models that make people feel <br>
insecure, there’s really not many “safe <br>
spaces” on social media where people can <br>
feel like they can be themselves.  <br><br>
<b>3. What drives you to engage/post <br> 
on social media? </b> <br> 
Honestly, I post on social media because <br>
I use them as little diaries where I can <br>
archive my experiences. I don’t feel as <br>
though I need to post on social media to <br>
“prove” that my life is this amazing, <br>
extravagant time; because it’s definitely <br>
not. I post the good, the bad, and the ugly. <br>
I just have a weird fear of forgetting <br>
special moments, so if they’re stored or <br>
documented on some sort of social media, <br>
I feel better.  <br> <br>
      </div>
      <div style="font-size: 1vw;">
        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
media have created for the worst? </b> <br>
Like I said before, people see certain things <br>
online that look “perfect” and they want their <br>
lives to emulate that image. This could be <br>
beauty/fashion standards or (weirdly enough) <br>
personality types. They see what gets a lot  <br>
of likes or retweets or views and they want <br>
that for themselves. People get so sucked <br>
into wish- ing they could be something/some- <br>
one else that they lose who they are in the <br>
process. I feel like this is a super strong <br>
trend with younger generations as well because <br>
social media is all they’ve ever known. I can’t  <br>
even try to imagine what it must be like to <br>
grow up with a childhood that is shaped <br>
by social media.  <br> <br>
<b>5. How much do you spend online? <br>
Follow up: Do you think it’s a <br>
healthy amount?</b>  <br>
I definitely spend way too much time online. <br>
Social media can be damaging to mental health, <br>
but it is also a nice escape from reality. I’m <br>
pretty secure and confident within myself, so <br>
I’m not really worried about social media damaging <br>
my mental health; life has already done that for me <br>
(lol). I know I can always go to Twitter if I need <br>
a good laugh, YouTube for any sort of tutorial, <br>
Facebook to check in with my family that I rarely <br>
talk to/ see, and Instagram to look at pictures of <br>
my crush/other cute boys. Just kidding. (Not really.)

      <B>1. How do you feel social media & <br>
the internet distort your reality?</B> <br>
I feel like social media negatively influ- <br>
ences people’s self confidence. The inter- <br>
net feeds us a lot of false information. <br>
A lot of people are gullible and believe <br>
whatever they read. <br> <br>
<b>2. What makes social media danger- <br>
ous to mental health? </b> <br>
Social media is dangerous to mental  <br>
health because we see pictures of influ- <br>
encers’ faces and bodies that are heavily <br>
edited/photoshopped and then feel disapp- <br>
pointed in ourselves for not looking like <br>
that. It sets unrealistic standards.. <br>
there are also a lot of triggering posts <br>
online and disturbing content.  <br> <br>
<b>3. What drives you to engage/post <br> 
on social media? </b> <br> 
Receiving positive attention and keeping <br>
people updated on exciting events in my <br>
life is what drives me to post on social <br>
media. <br> <br>
</div>
      <div style="font-size: 1vw;">
        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        <b>4. What social constructs have social <br>
media have created for the worst? </b> <br>
Social media makes people feel bad about <br> 
themselves for nor receiving a ridiculous <br>
amount of likes, followers, views, etc. <br>
when in real life none of those things <br>
matter. <br> <br>
<b>5. How much do you spend online? <br>
Follow up: Do you think it’s a <br>
healthy amount?</b>  <br>
I have a time limit on my phone for two <br>
hours of social media daily, but I def- <br>
nitely exceed it. I spend numerous hours <br>
on my phone a day. It’s very unhealthy <br>
and I do wish we didn’t need phones, but <br>
now we have them because of jobs, family, <br>
and contacting people, etc.

         <B>1. How do you feel social media & <br>
the internet distort your reality?</B> <br>
Social media makes people feel <br>
like they need to be doing things <br>
that are worthy of displaying to <br>
their friends 27/7 and if they  <br>
aren’t, it can definitely distort <br>
their reality. It makes them feel <br>
like they aren’t living life to <br>
the fullest when a lot of times <br>
the thing that happened behind <br>
the scenes are important for us to <br>
experience. Social media can have <br>
an effect on us and our minds and <br>
that makes us think that we’re not <br>
good enough when in reality we are.  <br> <br>
<b>2. What makes social media danger- <br>
ous to mental health? </b> <br>
Social media is also extremely <br>
dangerous to mental health because <br>
a lot of girls will edit their pictures so <br>
they’re look their very best which is <br>
absolutely fine, but when looking at <br>
social media posts we might forget <br>
that these pictures that we’re <br>
comparing our- selves to isn’t <br>
even the reality.  <br> <br>
<b>3. What drives you to engage/post <br> 
on social media? </b> <br> 
I want to engage in social media <br>
when I feel like I have something <br>
I would like to post and show my <br>
friends, or when I’m in the mood <br>
to be entertained or feel included <br>
by looking at my friends posts. <br>

        <b>4. What social constructs have social <br>
media have created for the worst? </b> <br>
Social media rarely had any posts <br>
that are of no edit or no make-up. <br> 
Posting a picture of text post about <br>
your problems is rare to see. People <br>
are expected to post their highlight <br>
reel and that’s it. <br> <br>
<b>5. How much do you spend online? <br>
Follow up: Do you think it’s a <br>
healthy amount?</b>  <br>
A lot more that I’d like- it’s an <br>
unhealthy amount when I scroll <br>
through social media like twit- <br>
ter and instagram for entertain- <br>
ment when I’m bored as opposed to <br>
going on them once or twice a day <br>
to just catch up on people’s <br>
posts quickly.

        <B>1. How do you feel social media & <br>
the internet distort your reality?</B> <br>
Social media distorts reality be- <br>
cause whoever is using the social <br>
media dictates what they choose to <br>
put out there. Majority of the time <br>
they put out only what they feel like <br>
is “likeable” or funny for popularity <br>
and instant gratification. Reality <br>
isn't always pretty, funny, <br>
and filtered. <br> <br>

<b>2. What makes social media danger- <br>
ous to mental health? </b> <br>
Social media is dangerous for your <br> 
mental health I feel like when you <br>
start to rely on it for the false <br>
gratification and you rely on it. <br>
to boost your self esteem. I know <br>
people who only post pics on IG at <br>
a certain time for likes and com- <br>
ments and/ or won’t take the risk <br>
of posting a candid ugly photo be- <br>
cause it won’t get any likes. <br> <br>
<b>3. What drives you to engage/post <br> 
on social media? </b> <br> 
I feel like social media can ac- <br>
tually be a very powerful tool to <br>
influence and inspire. That's what <br>
I use it for - to share and/ or <br>
follow music, fashion, art, de- <br>
sign, and humor (I like to laugh). <br>
Personally I don’t like posting a <br>
lot and I don’t like over exposure <br>
but It’s hard trying to establish <br>
a brand without taking advantage <br>
of that platform (Instagram).

        <b>4. What social constructs have social <br>
media have created for the worst? </b> <br>
I feel like everybody walks around <br>
hyper sensitive now and hyper <br>
insecure because of “likes” and <br>
“comments”. Also, as glib as this <br>
may sound, I feel like social me- <br>
dia has created this false sense <br>
of entitlement and people feel <br>
the need to share every opinion <br>
they have on subjects that they <br>
honestly aren’t interested in. <br> <br>
<b>5. How much do you spend online? <br>
Follow up: Do you think it’s a <br>
healthy amount?</b>  <br>
Honestly I spend way too much time <br>
on social media and on my phone in <br>
general, I’m trying to cut back. I <br>
use Instagram and Twitter primar- <br>
ily, but also tumblr still from time <br>
to time. For me Instagram and tumblr <br>
are visual stimuli and I actually <br>
collect a lot of images to recycle <br>
later for reference. Twitter is just <br>
funny as hell and I go on there <br>
to laugh!
